        <h1>Energy Startups around the World</h1>
        <h2>By Gavin Winter</h2>
        <p>
            Energy storage broadly encompasses both low- and high-tech systems for generating electricity, from hydro-power generated from the release of a 250-square mile reservoir to a fully-charged 4-square inch smart phone battery. Batteries themselves are as ubiquitous as the technology and devices they power. While grid energy storage is certainly not as sexy of a technology as Tesla’s fleet of electric vehicles (EVs), with their sleek lines and trims, crisp LEDs, and silent performance, grid storage is a piece of infrastructure that will sustain residential life and industrial sectors, serving as the critical missing link in the bigger picture of a future powered by intermittent renewable energy sources. While energy storage for electric vehicles will likely be limited to lithium-ion batteries because of their unmatched volumetric energy density and the constraining form factor of cars, the space for possible energy storage technologies for grid is much vaster. There are a multitude of low-tech energy storage methods that include, but are not limited to: pumped hydro, compressed air, flywheels, and fuel cells. As of right now, energy storage worldwide is dominated by pumped hydro (99% of total capacity) with compressed air at a distant second , but such forms of mechanically stored energy depend on the limited efficiency of the pumping system and energy conversion method. Each of these technologies has one pitfall that does not allow it to be feasible for grid-scale energy storage, whether that be the system’s cost, efficiency, or a lag-time before energy is available. For this reason, I will focus on highlighting the up-and-coming electrochemical energy storage technologies pioneered by various startups. There are other considerations for grid energy storage systems that include frequency-regulation and load shifting, but I will do my best to focus on the potential and advantages of each rather than get lost in technical weeds or get distracted by superficial marketing hype. Funding for the slew of start-ups comes from the U.S. Advanced Battery Consortium (USABC) and Department of Energy (DOE), as well as from private investors and venture capitalists (VCs). In terms of government funding, energy storage startups received $400 million for ARPA-E projects, which were an extension of the DOE, and an additional $2 billion in direct stimulus grants with Obama’s stimulus package in 2009.

        <section data-name="A123 Systems">
            <h3>A123 Systems</h3>
            <p><b>Founder:</b> Yet-Ming Chiang (founded in 2001)</p>
            <p><b>Funding received:</b> Almost $1B in total</p>
            <p><b>Claim to fame:</b> High-energy density Li-ion batteries for EV applications</p>
            One of the OG lithium-ion startups, A123 garnered a lot of media attention when it first raised $200 million in venture capital funding, was awarded $249 million as part of a federal grant affiliated with the Recovery Act of 2009, and IPO’d for $400 million. Hopes (and expectations) were especially high after key Tesla battery researcher and legend of the industry, Jeff Dahn, hailed A123 as having a very “impressive battery system,” noting the battery chemistry’s high power and low-temperature capabilities. The chemistry consisted of a lithium iron phosphate cathode and graphite anode, but that is now an outdated chemistry since metal oxide cathodes containing nickel, manganese, cobalt, and aluminum have significantly higher energy density. A123 initially sought a committed, exclusive relationship with Fisker, the luxury automotive manufacturer sued by Tesla in 2008 for copying the Model S. Irrespective of Fisker’s status or their readiness to deploy a fully-electric luxury automobile for which they were still trying to find high-end customers, there were several false starts with A123 recalling batteries and with money lost on each battery unit sold ($1.57 for every $1 revenue from the auto-manufacturer). In order to tap into the economies of scale, it was noted that at least 50,000 battery packs would need to be manufactured on an annual basis, and while A123 also had pending deals with GM to integrate A123’s battery systems into the GM Spark, most of the company’s resources were being dedicated to the failing prospect with Fisker. After selling 80% of the company for $450 million, A123 eventually became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Chinese auto-parts manufacturer Wanxiang, sparking dissent among a growing body of critics who were alarmed by the transfer of federally-funded intellectual property being transferred to a foreign entity. (However, it is important to note that the only other option for A123 was to go bankrupt and cease all operations.) Nevertheless, manufacturing would now be done in China via an accelerated platform, and research would remain within the U.S. per the requirement of DOE grants to provide funding for domestic assets. Despite A123’s failure to scale-up manufacturing independently, they were noted as being a driver for advancing GM’s own battery chemistry further.

        <section data-name="Boston Power">
            <h3>Boston Power</h3>
            <p><b>Founder:</b> Dr. Christina Lampe-Onnerud (founded in 2005)</p>
            <p><b>Funding received:</b> $370M</p>
            <p><b>Claim to fame:</b> Large format Li-ion batteries with a 10-year lifespan</p>
            One of the other OG lithium-ion startups, and now likely the largest lithium-ion startup, at least by volume of units sold. Their units were first designed as long lifetime batteries for HP and Asus computers. These battery chemistries in their time were closest to maturity and ready for full-scale commercialization, but are now comparatively outdated chemistries. Boston Power’s manufacturing division moved off to China soon after the company’s founding, following a similar trend to A123 and many other traditional li-ion startups partnering with Chinese manufacturing companies. Boston Power announced in 2015 that they dedicated significant resources in to supply 30,000 battery packs to Chinese EV manufacturers. Lampe-Onnerud went on to found Cadenza Innovation with some of the same R&D folks from Boston Power, focusing on modular batteries for EV applications.</section>
        <section data-name="24M Technologies">
            <h3>24M Technologies</h3>
            <p><b>Founder:</b> Yet-Ming Chiang (founded in 2010)</p>
            <p><b>Funding received:</b> $54.5M in total (excluding possible funding from an industrial partner)</p>
            <p><b>Claim to fame:</b> Low-cost manufacturing technology for Li-ion batteries; possibly indicating that they will soon dip below the $100/kWh threshold for widespread employment of grid energy storage</p>
            After noting cost as the limiting factor in the li-ion industry, Professor Yet-Ming Chiang of MIT sought to tackle the time and cost issues that plague the conventional li-ion electrode-making process. 24M received approximately $50 million from esteemed venture capital firms such as Charles River Ventures and North Bridge Venture Partners. 24M’s manufacturing process employs a semi-solid material of dough-like consistency to make thicker electrodes that maximize the active material (energy-storing material) by removing 80% of supporting inactive materials. Since the lifetime of lithium ion batteries is limited due to their noted capacity fade, end-of-life is an important consideration, and less inactive material streamlines the recycling process by reducing the need to segregate components or battery materials. By eliminating some of these inactive materials, 24M also claims that their li-ion cells can be manufactured in a fifth of the time with few additional processing steps to dry and compress the electrode film. With fewer processing steps, and with each step being drastically simpler, a modular manufacturing line would ease the process of scaling up. While they are currently in negotiations with a host of tentative industrial partners throughout Asia in the hopes of launching high volume manufacturing in 2018, 24M also advertises their role as an “Integrator,” potentially allowing them to license their manufacturing technology similar to how Intel Inside provides microprocessor manufacturing expertise for use in laptop products. 24M is eager to emphasize that their primary focus is on grid applications. With a secondary focus on the volatile EV market, they are wary of the materials expenditures required to fabricate cells with higher energy density for this market.

        <section data-name="StoreDot">
            <h3>StoreDot</h3>
            <p><b>Founder:</b> Doron Myersdorf (founded in 2012)</p>
            <p><b>Funding received:</b> $108M in total</p>
            <p><b>Claim to fame:</b> 5 minute fast charge for both phone and EV batteries</p>
            StoreDot has received funding from Samsung to assist in developing the fast-charge function for phones, and received $60 million from Mercedes parent-company Daimler earlier in 2017. While the traditional li-ion battery focuses on a fast discharge only, StoreDot redesigned all components of the battery. Instead, they use a proprietary multi-function electrode that capitalizes on the synergy of all components to allow ions to flow significantly quicker, enabling both high-power capability and high energy density for longer discharge times. Like the other energy storage startups (who have not gone bankrupt in the commercialization phase), StoreDot is planning to build its own gigafactory (on a 1 GWh production scale in comparison to Tesla’s 35 GWh scale), and expects to release their first product in 2020. Daimler’s main objective is to assemble these battery packs for use in their trucks, which would compete with the newly released work-horse Tesla Semi and Mitsubishi’s comparable low-cost model, but they also plan to employ the battery packs in the rest of their fleet from luxury to economy vehicles.

            <h3>Seeo</h3>
            <p><b>Founder:</b> Hany Eitouni, Ilan Gur, Mohit Singh (founded in 2007)</p>
            <p><b>Funding received:</b> $44.6M in total</p>
            <p><b>Claim to fame:</b> Nanostructured polymer electrolyte for solid-state li-ion batteries</p>
            The nanostructured polymer electrolyte developed by Seeo enables high energy densities and reduces the possibility of electrolyte decomposition, an issue that typically leads to abbreviated battery lifetimes. An additional perk of the technology is the non-flammable nature of the battery since it is solid-state. Initial investments were made by Khosla Ventures, Samsung, and USABC, the latter of which stated an interest in evaluating Seeo’s batteries for use in EVs. While there have not been many press releases regarding how the company might be scaling-up production, representatives from Seeo did confirm that the company was acquired by Bosch in late 2015.

        <section data-name="Amprius">
            <h3>Amprius</h3>
            <p><b>Founder:</b> Yi Cui, Mark Platshon (founded in 2008)</p>
            <p><b>Funding received:</b> $55M in total</p>
            <p><b>Claim to fame:</b> Silicon nanowires anode for li-ion batteries</p>
            Silicon, an anode material of particular interest in recent years, has a theoretical capacity greater than 10x that of graphite, the conventional anode material. Thus, silicon anodes would potentially enable significantly higher energy densities if they could be incorporated in li-ion batteries. (Tesla uses a proprietary graphite/silicon blend of some sort in their own batteries.) However, most issues with silicon arise from drastic volume change upon cycling, which leads to pulverization of particles and short lifetimes of batteries. After research at Stanford University demonstrated how a form of nanostructured silicon could allow for stable cycling and longer lifetimes, Amprius was started to commercialize this technology. Amprius initially received funding from investors such as Kleiner Perkins, Google Executive Chairman, Stanford University. It is important to note that manufacturing of nanostructured silicon is no small feat, requiring very energy- and capital-intensive processes like chemical vapor deposition (CVD), which are typically reserved for electronics fabrication. Sila Nanotechnologies, a startup founded by Tesla’s seventh employee and a Georgia Tech professor, is working to develop a similar silicon nanostructured anode for high energy density batteries.

            <p><b>Founder:</b> Dr. Christina Lampe-Onnerud (founded in 2005)</p>
            <p><b>Funding received:</b> $370M</p>
            <p><b>Claim to fame:</b> Large format Li-ion batteries with a 10-year lifespan</p>
            Founded by Professor Jay Whitacre of Carnegie Mellon University, who previously developed batteries for NASA’s Mars rover missions, Aquion carries a vision of electrifying off-grid areas in developing countries, employing long lifetime batteries with cheap, earth-abundant elements such as sodium and magnesium. In addition to a $5 million federal grant, Aquion also received funding from VCs like Kleiner Perkins, Shell*, as well as Bill Gates. Made with readily-available, and in some cases household supplies, such as stainless steel and an aqueous electrolyte the batteries with magnesium oxide cathode and carbon-based anode exhibit superior safety performance as well as the ability to manufacture the cell on packing equipment designed for food and pharmaceuticals. In addition, Aquion also made claims that their battery is capable of 5,000 discharge and charge cycles, which would approximately equate to a 10-year lifetime on the grid. However, the battery’s low energy density characteristic to low-cost battery chemistries limits its application to grid use, where space occupied by the system is not an issue. Aquion initially found a niche market with small boutique grid operators in Napa Valley and Hawaii and made somewhat vague statements that they would scale-up production to “hundreds of megawatts.” But, poor timing with the fall of li-ion battery prices faster than anticipated (to just under $300/kWh) in 2016, the small and limited market for specialized grid applications led Aquion to lay off 80% of staff in March 2017 and file bankruptcy later in 2017. However, Juline-Titans LLC, a majority American-owned joint venture and affiliate of China’s Titans Energy Technology Group, saw the potential of Aquion’s technology because of its lower lifetime cost and purchased the company for $9 million. Again, the manufacturing facility was moved to China, while R&amp;D remained in Pittsburgh.

            <p><b>Claim to fame:</b> High energy density lithium metal battery for specialized consumer devices applications</p>
            SolidEnergy Systems has a vision of making batteries for drones that will provide wi-fi in remote areas. With funding from investors like GM Ventures and SAIC, SolidEnergy will seek to further penetrate other parts of the consumer devices market with watches, smartphones, and wearable devices. While lithium metal anode chemistries still have safety and recharge issues, they hold the promise of increased energy density (which is why you would want to use them for small devices that require a lot of energy). SolidEnergy has also encountered issues with unwanted dendrite growth that leads to short circuits and failure. To combat this, SolidEnergy developed a proprietary hybrid electrolyte for coating the anode to enhance low-temperature performance and reduce its volatility. SolidEnergy developed their technology with conventional Li-ion manufacturing in mind to ease integration, and ironically enough, they signed a deal with A123 to use their old manufacturing line in Waltham, MA.

        <section data-name="Baseload Renewables">
            <h3>Baseload Renewables</h3>
            <p><b>Founder:</b> Yet-Ming Chiang (founded in 2017)</p>
            <p><b>Funding received:</b> $2M (as of yet raised by MIT Engine)</p>
            <p><b>Claim to fame:</b> Long-discharge, low-cost flow battery for grid</p>
            MIT Engine, a startup accelerator for “tough tech,” announced the introduction of Baseload Renewables, founded by Chiang and former employees of both 24M and Aquion. Baseload Renewables makes the bold claim that the sulfur-based flow battery that they are developing will be manufactured at a fifth of the cost of where li-ion is expected to plateau. This dramatic cost reduction is in part due to the sulfur feedstock for the flow battery, which is available at very low cost as a waste product of the oil and gas industry. The flow battery design consists of a sulfur-containing polymer that serves as anolyte and proprietary metal salt that serves as catholyte. Anolyte and catholyte are both pumped from reservoirs of each liquid into a central cell through which current can flow. With sufficient power delivery, the proposed flow battery would deliver significant quantities of energy over a long discharge times that are currently limited to pumped hydroelectric power. (It is important to note that some can be regenerated by electric power like a regular rechargeable battery, but some must be replenished by complete removal of material like a fuel cell. Furthermore, with flow batteries, the liquid electrolyte volume and the gross surface area of the electrode determines the energy and power capabilities, and thus the energy storage system would likely not be very compact.) The technology is 3-5 years away from commercialization and deployment, according to Baseload Renewables, but they hope to partner with an already successful and mature manufacturer.

        <h2>Take-away 1:</h2>
        <p>
            The long development time to reach manufacturing scale and slow advancements with li-ion have culminated in only gradual improvements with no huge leaps in innovation. Professor Ceder of UC Berkeley estimated that it costs “$500 million to set up small manufacturing line.” However, with a multitude of start-ups attempting to commercialize their respective products and with few of these start-ups receiving more than $30 million, the odds seem stacked against clean energy. Furthermore, many of these startups taking deep dives and pioneering early-stage energy storage technologies that may have a lot of potential, follow similar trajectories: either they go bankrupt or acquire an industrial partner, often foreign, and often Chinese. In order to accelerate development to put a product out on the market, and understandably so, they rush to integrate the battery technology into a conventional manufacturing line, further restricting potential developments and as a result stifling innovation. While all this may seem like a “shotgun approach” to next-gen energy storage, when viewed over an accurate timeline, each new venture and step is very calculated, each generation of serial entrepreneurs tweaking their strategy based on previous shortcomings. Numerous technical challenges remain, but each technology must be taken through to commercialization or until funding runs dry.
        </p>

        <h2>Take-away 2: </h2>
        <p>
            For better or for worse, the proverbial Big Three (LG Chem, Panasonic, and Samsung) are taking only safe bets, making no radical changes in chemistry. This strategy is the result of: perceived risk in next-generation technologies and an already well-established market for li-ion batteries with consumer devices such as mobile phones, drones, and toys. Since economies of scale set in at around $12 million in revenue, but the consensus is that at least $100-500 million is required to attain high volume manufacturing capability, there is a significant gap that must be cleared by early-stage energy storage startups in order to break simultaneously bring a product to market and scale up quickly enough to break through the metaphorical ceiling with commercialization and tap into the benefits of scale. As a result, few early- and mid-stage startups can successfully bring a product to market and generate profit, while remaining fully independent from larger conventional cell manufacturers.
        </p>
        <h2>Limits of Li-ion</h2>
        <p>
            The cathode active materials are the key component of li-ion batteries for maximizing energy density, but they also contribute to a significant portion of raw material cost. With each generation of EVs, the cathode active materials have transitioned from lithium iron phosphate to lithium metal oxide chemistries with nickel, manganese, cobalt, and aluminum in different ratios in each distinct crystal structure . In terms of anode active materials, silicon has emerged as the active material of choice when blended with graphite . As discussed earlier, pure silicon anodes do not have long lifetimes due to swelling and pulverization of silicon particles. With startups like Amprius, Sila Nanotechnologies, and Nanosys, nanostructured silicon has been employed, improving cycling stability for these higher energy density materials. However, this use of nanotechnology is not nearly as economical or scalable, so silicon oxide and carbon alloy blends are a good compromise between high energy density, good cycling stability, and low cost.
        </p>
        <p>
            Conductive additives and electrolyte development have also been central to achieving high power capability since voltage fade and resistance incrementally increase with rigorous cycling of li-ion batteries. Electrolyte development has also permitted expansion of the operating temperature window for li-ion batteries, extending their utility in defense and aerospace as well as in the civilian world.
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently, few other energy storage technologies rival the energy density and power characteristics of li-ion, but li-ion must reach approximately 350 Wh/kg to enable EVs with a 300-mile range. According to a study conducted jointly by Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and Envia Systems, a 350 Wh/kg target can be attained for under $10,000 but that is likely the practical limit. A battery with 400 Wh/kg capability can be built to enable extended driving ranges up to 600 miles, but not without surpassing the cost limit for a budget EV. Thus, in comparison to combustion engines, the energy and power densities are limited at an upper ceiling, and the cost of li-ion will likely plateau just below $100/kWh since the unit cost of the battery cannot fall below the raw materials costs of the various metal oxides, graphite, and solvents.
        </p>
        <p>
            The realm of Li-ion is already at a high degree of maturity after numerous developments since 1980s in the consumer devices market. While there may be new cell components such as current collector or separator materials that improve the thermal stability and extend the battery’s lifetime by mitigating the degradation of cell materials, the fundamental chemistry will not change significantly. New cathode active materials with novel crystal structures that enhance diffusion pathways and other fun stuff would be required to make any notable improvements in energy density, but significant work with theoretical and computational materials science have for the most part exhausted possibilities of new materials for li-ion storage and diffusion. Thus, there will be no drastic improvements in the power and energy able to be stored and delivered by this class of batteries.
        </p>

        <h2>Research Beyond Li-ion: Mid-Term Outlook</h2>
        <p>
            While many of the startups highlighted previously in this article have demonstrated a proof-of-concept for a range of technologies at various stages of maturity, a large portion of mid-term academic research is focused on the higher energy density lithium-metal and sodium-metal battery chemistries. Much directed research is conducted in China and South Korea, which are also unsurprisingly manufacturing hotspots. Despite a big bump up in energy density, safety is the primary pitfall with lithium-metal batteries, and li-ion batteries have already raised significant concern with recalls, fires, and explosions, plaguing even big players in the industry like Tesla, GM, and Samsung.
        </p>
        <p>
            Colorado University and University of Michigan, and companies like Seeo, have invented solid-state electrolytes that could complement lithium-metal batteries. While technical challenges remain with the rate capability at the interface between solid electrolyte and solid electrode, the advantages of this class of electrolyte are numerous, including: improved safety at higher voltages, no electrolyte to degrade, and the ability to manufacture the battery in an ambient environment. Due to the sensitivity and reactivity of some typical liquid electrolytes, some batteries cannot currently be fabricated in an air environment.
        </p>
        <p>
            Research Beyond Li-ion: Long-Term Outlook Flow batteries similar to those being developed by Baseload Renewables and other startups are capable of long discharge durations and can be relatively inexpensive, depending on their material feedstock. For this reason, they would be well-suited for stationary commercial and residential grid applications.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the quest for a sub-$100/kWh energy storage technology, researchers at Harvard University have developed a flow battery that harnesses the redox potential of water-soluble organic molecules classified as quinones. Extracted from plants like rhubarb and aloe vera, quinones include some commonly known substances like Vitamin K1 and Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), that supplement incessantly advertised in TV commercials. Relying on simple chemistry with small molecules with high potential through reversible hydrogenation, a central reaction in organic chemistry, the process uses many of the same molecules used in biochemical pathways for photosynthesis and cellular respiration and is highly tunable with simple modification to functional groups of the molecules. Like most flow batteries, this quinone-based flow battery would have comparatively low energy density, but the technology capitalizes on li-ion’s downsides: short lifetimes and high cost. The quinone battery has a long lifetime since it is all-liquid and there are minimal components to degrade, and it is inexpensive becomes all the materials are readily available, estimated as low as $21/kWh.
        </p>
        <p>
            Similarly, an all-iron flow battery is currently being studied at Case Western Reserve University. The primary feedstock, an early-determiner for cost-modelling, is iron, readily available on the order of nearly 50 million metric tons annually. The research team at Case Western is encountering several difficulties with gas evolution and the efficiency of ions plating over an area. While the power delivered is sufficient, this plating density issue and efficiency limits the energy density of such energy storage systems. However, with a continuous flow of iron and a large electrode area, sufficient power can be delivered for long durations to meet grid energy demands.

            In the realm of high-energy density mechanisms that would parallel li-ion for EV applications, one research group from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory is actively using theoretical and computational materials science to assist in materials discovery and understand of possible energy-storage mechanisms (Ceder Group). Understanding of these fundamental thermodynamics will allow for determination of future possible energy storage chemistries.

            Chemistries for uber high-energy density applications are certainly possible (often using nanotechnology), but only seem to be viable for niche applications like super-secret CIA drones or NASA spacecraft because they are cost-prohibitive. As many experts have mentioned , it will be a battery of choice since it is difficult to maximize all desirable performance benchmarks.

        <h2>A mindset of skeptical optimism</h2>
        <p>
            It is a safe bet to predict that lithium-ion or lithium-metal will be the preferred battery chemistry for EVs of the future, but the specific components used and manufacturing methods employed could be anybody’s guess. As for grid energy storage, a low-cost, long-discharge, high-reliability energy storage technology like a flow battery will likely enable the wind-/solar-powered, distributed grid networks that power engineers and blockchain strategists are dreaming up. Regardless, if there is a hope for such systems replacing natural gas or coal power plants and for EVs replacing combustion engine vehicles, claims of sustainable green energy raise the question of these manufactured materials’ footprint. That is, where are these materials sourced from? Are they sourced ethically and from a long-term sustainable supply chain? What are the lifetimes of these materials? What are the technical challenges in recycling and recovering high-value materials? These are all questions that will be addressed in an upcoming article.

            To an outsider, the world of battery start-ups may seem incestuous, where the same chief researchers driving development have their hand in early-stage development at many different ventures overcoming roadblocks and emerging from bankruptcy; where old manufacturing facilities from failed start-ups are re-purposed for new ones; where funding is pieced together between federal grants, various consortia, venture capital, and in some cases multinational companies, each with their special interest and target application. One must recognize that it is an unique venture space that may not be suited to the quick results that venture capitalists might be looking for in other areas like software or app development. Significant material investments and commitments must be made before a technology may even be deemed commercially viable, accounting for the ephemeral nature of many of these startups when funding finally runs out.
        </p>
        <p>
            While these individual companies may go bankrupt, or are absorbed into a larger multinational corporation that may stifle innovation, the initial conception will continue to serve as the impetus for creating new chemistries and new mechanisms.
        </p>
        <p>
            If the answer does not lie in the U.S., maybe it is in China, where much of the funding and the drive is coming from. Even if novel research originated in the U.S., startups must follow the funding to stay afloat, regardless of the source, and the risk in execution often lies in scaling up manufacturing capability.
        </p>
        <p>
            From a birds-eye view, it can be almost frustrating to watch how slow things progress in this realm. Why can we not just mash up all the benefits of each technology (fast charge, long lifetime, etc.) in one neat package? Why is there no true universally-compatible drop-in for manufacturing lines? Why can we not combine the flexibility of a R&D startup with the streamlined efficiency and resources of a full-scale commercial company? It is a complex system with many variables and many approaches taken from different angles, but we must remain confident that the confluence of bright minds or at least one venture will realize and commercialize a worthy solution.
